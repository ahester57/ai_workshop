    abstract = {The risk for seafood poisoning has grown exponentially over the past 50 years will likely continue to increase over the next decade. The most common cause of a seafood-related illness is scombroid poisoning; however, poisonings associated with harmful algal bloom (HAB)-related toxins continue to rise. These algal toxins include ciguatoxins, saxitoxins, domoic acid, brevetoxins, okadaic acid, azaspiracids, and tetrodotoxins, and the majority are neurotoxic. Symptoms vary from mild to severe and fatalities have been reported in some cases. Since there is no antidote for these illnesses, treatment is largely symptomatic. Rapid and accurate diagnosis would be facilitated by advanced studies of exposure biomarkers as well as human thresholds for illness. In the United States, aggressive monitoring of endemic coastal regions is under way with risk communication serving as a critical component of illness prevention.}
