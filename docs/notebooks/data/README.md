# Datasets

We will be studying tabular, non-time-series data.

> One debate which we only touch on briefly in the report is: what is the best type of model for tabular data problems?
> 
> As a quick reminder, by tabular data problems we mean any problem where the training data is structured as rows and
> columns of scalar numerical values — in contrast to problems where the data is structured as a series of images,
> or text, or interactions between an agent and its environment.
> 
> Many “business ML” problems fall into the category of tabular data problems.
> The main candidate models in recent years for tabular data are neural networks and gradient-boosted decision
> trees (GBDTs) , and the debate over which is better has been going on for a while.
> 
> Gradient-boosted decision trees are ensemble models — combinations of many smaller models — and are iteratively built up, one tree at a time. Popular GBDT libraries include LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost.
