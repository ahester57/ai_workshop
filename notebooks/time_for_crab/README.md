# Time for Crab

Crabs are here, and they're mighty tasty.

Knowing how old they are helps identify full-sized crabs that are ready for the pot.

## Reasons for Choosing This Dataset

A good dataset is the foundation of a good model.

#### My reasons:

- Highly-rated tabular data with a natural prediction target (Age).
- Regression task since I like a challenge.
- Features easy to conceptualize for feature engineering.
- On the smaller side to quickly iterate on.
- Crabs are cool.

##### Reasons given by the [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidhus/crab-age-prediction):

> Its a great starting point for classical regression analysis and feature engineering and understand the impact of feature engineering in Data Science domain.
> For a commercial crab farmer knowing the right age of the crab helps them decide if and when to harvest the crabs. Beyond a certain age, there is negligible growth in crab's physical characteristics and hence, it is important to time the harvesting to reduce cost and increase profit.
