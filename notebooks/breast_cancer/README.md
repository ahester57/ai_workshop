# Binary Classification using Machine Learning

### Problem
 We would like to design a smart agent that can predict if a female patient is suffering from breast cancer or not, i.e., whether her tumor is malignant or benign.
- Relevant Dataset located in `breast-cancer.csv`

#### Questions
- What kind of prior knowledge that our agent is going to have?
- What kind of data and feedback are available?
- What is the size of the data?
- How to load a dataset that has non-numbers?
- What are the features (predictors and target variable) in my data?
- What kind of model is suitable for this task?
- What kind of evaluation metric is suitable for this task?
- What kind of preprocessing is required for this task?
- What kind of feature engineering is required for this task?
